## The Vision
Current wearables demand that we speak their language. OeMga.me learns ours.

Today’s bio-sensors with rigid FSMs and pre-trained models, force the user to conform to the machine’s limitations. OeMga.me dismantles this paradigm. We are architecting the first **Teachable Bio-Interaction Platform**, where intelligence lives at the edge and evolves with you.

## The Foundation: OeMga $\alpha$
This repository hosts the open-source hardware files for the foundational module of the OeMga $\alpha$ platform: a high-precision, teachable EMG sensor.
